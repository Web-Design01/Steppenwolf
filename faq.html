            <h2 id="topic1">What are some hobbies that you enjoy?></h2>
                <p> There are two main hobbies that I indulge in. Those hobbies being walking and software developement.
                For starters, i need to get back into walking since I have been getting lazy over the summer. Walking enables 
                me to get some good ideas of what I would like to do. 
                    My interest in software developement was more apparent during my years of high school. Just the thought of
                creating a webpage is what got me interested. As time passed, I thought it would be nice to work in a software 
                developement field as a career.</p>
            <h2 id="topic2">Tell us more about where you're from.></h2>
                 <p>I am from where the weather is always hot and get little to no rain in the summer. The temperature reaches a high 100
                 degrees in the summer.</p>
            <h2 id="topic3">Is Steppenwolf tied into anything else?></h2>
                <p> With careful research, it is said to be related to a DC comics character. Steppenwolf is a DC comic character
                based in the Justice League series and is a villain. There is also a rockband that goes by the name Steppenwolf.  </p>
            <h2 id="topic4">Where do you see yourself ten years from now?></h2>
                <p> Ten years from now, I plan to be a well known animator and a successful software developer. With the
                knowledge of graphic design and software developement, that would be useful in creating a webpage to show
                off some works. It would be a great way for putting those past skills to good use instead of being wasted.</p>
            <h2 id="topic5">What are your lifetime goals?></h2>
                <p> As mentioned above, a life time goal that I set would be to become a well-known animator and software
                developer. Another goal would be to go out of the country to see what they had to offer. Many dream of going
                out of the country to see how different people go through life. That is one of the goals that I personally
                would like to do someday.</p>
            <h2 id="topic6">What are you most passionate about?></h2>
                <p> A passion I have is to be a well prepared and exceptional software developer. I plan to take the steps necessary
                 to realise this passion. Whether it be taking classes or finding a career in this field to help better understand the
                 inner workings. These things and more is to help this passion come to life.</p>
            <h2 id="topic7">Do you enjoy what you do?></h2>
                <p> For the time being, I am working hard to be a professional animator. It's gonna take time since this isn't something
                that will just happen overnight. The proper steps are drawing in my free time then start working with animation software. 
                It is estimated that the best animators took at least two to three years to get to where they are now. </p> 
            <h2 id="topic8">What is something about yourself that you would change?></h2>
                <p> Something that I would change is how kind and carefree I can be at times. Some might see it as having a good character developement.
                In all honesty, I see it more as a weekness to me. At times I care too much or too friendly then that is what gets me hurt in the long run. 
                So those would be the main things i would work on in the future.</p>
