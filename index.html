                    <p><em> Hello,I am Steppenwolf.  I am twenty-two years old and I am taking the initiative of going back to college and picking up a career in computer software.
            I hope to learn a lot about the process of web design.</em></p>
                    <p> I currently am enrolled in two courses, my second one starts in October. Hope to gain the 
            knowledge and skils required to be able to design software and create websites using code.This would be 
            my second associates degree which I am working towards.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p> There are a number of things that I like to do in my spare time. One of them being designing house floorplans.
            I generally would make random floorplans.Otherwise, I would use any design template available.</p>
                    <p> Another hobby I have to get back into is going for walks in the morning. Since it has been hot in the state,
            I have not been able to get back into walking.I have spent most of this time either watching movies or going to work.</p>

                <h3>Why I am taking this course</h3>
                    <p><em> The reason I took up interest in this course is to go into software development. This course is one of many that I
            need to continue further. So far I like this course since it is pretty straight forward. I hope to obtain a vast knowledge 
            of creating a webpage, and hopefully create my own webpage someday..</em></p>
                    <p> Another reason I am taking this course is to become skilled at using the HTML format to create a webpage. Before today, 
            I never knew how to use the HTML format nor the different characters that goes into making a webpage. Throughout the course, 
            I want to get a better understanding of what goes into a webpage in the HTML format.</p>
